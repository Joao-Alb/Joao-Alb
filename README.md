## Hello there!

I'm João Albuquerque, an Automation and Control Engineer who loves building smart things — from embedded systems to AI-powered tools.

I’ve been diving deep into AI and ADAS, and also developing an agent that helps small business owners understand their data without needing a data team.

I’m also into robotics, data analysis, and anything that mixes tech + creativity.
If you’ve got a project, an idea, or just want to talk I’m always up for a chat.
